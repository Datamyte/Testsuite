   <h6>STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMMES</h6><br><br>
   <h7> Face to Face with the Alumni</h7><br><br>
   <h8>We invite our alumni studying and working in different premiere institutes in India and abroad to come to
    our department and interact with the students. This personal interaction is a very effective way of
    communicating to the students a feel for the career of a researcher and academic in physics and this
    experience motivates them for a life in physics. In addition, these sessions provide the students a window
    into the variety of academic experiences offered by different institutions in India and abroad. The alumni
    discuss the nature of different entrance examinations after the BSc and MSc, the types of questions asked
    in these tests and interviews and the kind of preparations needed. We also request our alumni to present
    before the students an outline of their research work so as to expose the students to some of the current
    research areas in physics. In the past few years we conducted five interactive sessions with the alumni.
    Last year we arranged an interactive session with students from other colleges who were the IIT-JAM
    toppers of the state. Also, our alumni have been among the resource persons in eight of the seminars and
    workshops we organized in the past few years. The recent face to face sessions and the programmes
    where our alumni served as resource persons are listed below. We have conducted 14 such programmes in
    collaboration with our alumni in recent years.</h8><br><br>

    <h7>Internship in Premiere Institutes for Msc Students</h7><br><br>
    <h8>From 2017 batch onwards we have been insisting that our MSc students should complete their project by
      internship at a premiere institute in India. We encourage the students to write directly to faculty members
      in different institutes. Whenever they encounter difficulties in finding a guide for their project in a
      national level institute, we step in and arrange the internship. Our students spend a period of around two
      months in one of the national level institutes like IIT, IISER, NIT, IUCAA, HCU, IIST, RRI etc. and
      complete their MSc project. This extended stay in these premiere institutes has been a motivation for the
      students to take up research in physics after their MSc. The list of MSc students who had done internship
      in premiere institutes in the last three years is given below.<br>
      In addition, we encourage the students to apply for the summer research fellowship offered by Indian
      Science Academies. Two students in 2017 batch, Akhil Raman T S and Akshaya K C have done their
      projects under this fellowship. Two students in 2017 batch have joined for PhD at University of Hyderabad (Akhil Raman T S) and
      Manipal Academy of Higher Education (Alina Peethan) and another student has qualified NET
      examination (Akshaya K C). Anupama Mohanan of 2018 batch has secured 3rd rank at the university level
      for MSc. Anusree C V of 2019 batch has qualified GATE and Ramseena Thundiyil of 2019 batch will be 
      joining a project at IISER-Mohali in August this year, which will be an extension of her MSc project. In
      general, the students in these batches exhibit a keen interest in pursuing a career of research in physics.</h8><br><br>

      <h7> Training for national level tests for BSc students </h7><br><br>
      <h8>We identify early on the highly talented students of each BSc batch through a post admission test and
        continuous interaction and academic evaluation. We conduct a regular training programme to these
        students to enable them study their subjects more critically and deepen their understanding through the
        practice of solving problems. We also encourage them to solve the previous question papers of different
        national level MSc entrance tests like JAM, JEST, and the entrance tests to different central universities.
        To give the students the experience of writing these entrance tests we regularly conduct two annual tests
        at our department : (1) Physics Talent Search Examination organized by Academy of Physics Teachers
        (APT), Kerala and (2) National Standard Examination in Physics organized by Indian Academy of
        Physics Teachers (IAPT). A good number of students attend these tests every year and those who excel in
        them generally do well in the MSc entrance tests at the end of their BSc programme. A list of these tests
        conducted in the past six years is given below.

        <h7>Sreerekha Memorial Reference Library</h7><br><br>
        <h8>Sreerekha S was an alumna of Physics Dept. in 2013 BSc
          batch.<br>
          She was studious and a cheerful person who always made
          everyone happy with her blissfulness. She used to support
          and encourage people around her to achieve their dreams as
          well.<br>
          Sreerekha had her primary education from Govt HSS
          Perambra during which she participated in 17th National
          Children's Science Congress-2010. After her graduation from
          Govt. college Madappally in 2013 she completed her MSc in
          Physics in 2015 from physics dept. of Calicut University. Her
          work during her internship for MSc project at RRI,
          Bangalore, was published in Physical Review A 93, 042504
          (2016).<br>
          Sreerekha had been an ad hoc faculty of Physics Dept. of
          Govt. Colege Madappally for a few months in 2016. She
          qualified GATE in 2016 and was selected for PhD
          programme at both IIT-Madras and IIT-Bombay. She
          subsequently joined for PhD in high energy physics division
          at IIT Bombay in January 2017.<br>
          Sreerekha’s sudden demise was on 15 March 2017 due to
          cancer.
          A few months later Sreerekha’s parents Muraleedhara Varrier
          and Balasaraswathi Varrier decided to keep her memory alive
          by extending their support to the students of this dept. With
          their financial support Sreerekha Memorial Reference
          Library and Reading Room was opened in the department
          on 3rd Aug 2017. It has 215 books now and a subscription of
          3 journals. During their leisure time and after their classes the
          students can use the books and journals collected there
          without any restrictions. The classes for the training
          programme for national level tests for BSc students are also
          being conducted here.</h8><br><br>

      <h7>Endowments </h7><br><br>
      <h8>1. Sreerekha Memorial Endowment is a merit cum
        means scholarship instituted in 2017 by the class mates
        and friends of Sreerekha to support one 5th semester BSc
        student and one 3rd semester MSc student.
        The endowment was distributed to the students in
        December 2017 and November 2018. The recipients in
        2017 were Alina Peethan (MSc) and Anand Das T K
        (BSc) and in 2018, Aswathi K (MSc) and Priya
        Narayanan (BSc)<br><br>
        2. In 2018 Sreerekh’a parents have instituted an
        endowment to support one final semester BSc student
        apply for national level MSc entrance tests. Under this
        Rs.10,000 was awarded to the sixth semester student
        Fathimathul Sahala of 2019 BSc batch.<br><br>
        3. The faculty members of the department have set up an
        endowment fund on a merit cum means basis to support
        one BSc student to pursue MSc rpogramme. So far two
        students have been supported with this endowment.
        Midhun V K of 2016 BSc batch was awarded Rs.30,000
        and Fathimathul Sahala of 2019 BSc batch was awarded
        Rs.16,000.<br><br>
        4. In 2017 Physics alumni of 1989 BSc batch have set up
        an endowment fund on merit cum means basis to support
        BSc students. Under this Rs.3500 each has been
        distributed to two students of 2017 BSc batch, Sindhya A
        and Akhil Kumar K K and one student of 2016 BSc
        batch, Akshay M S.</h8><br><br>
